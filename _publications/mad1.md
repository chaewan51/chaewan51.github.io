Introduces **MAD**, a dialogue-structured benchmark with aligned audio, sentence-level check-worthiness, and claim-level veracity to study fact-checking in spoken, multi-turn conversations. Baselines with RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, and Llama-3 show the task remains challenging, especially at the dialogue level (≈72% accuracy). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
